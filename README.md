###How to install
This project uses node so install that first, along with npm.

After you have node and npm installed, then in the project root run `npm install` to install dependencies from package.json

Change line 3 of `app.js` to reflect your current IP or `localhost`, and change it in line 20 of `index.html` as well

###How to Run
In the project root, run `node app.js` or `nodejs app.js` if you are on linux
